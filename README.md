For the Track that we selected is **Industry Collaboration**.

**Problem Statement**
Manual counting is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error, especially when dealing with large volumes. This inefficiency often leads to inconsistencies and slows down productivity, highlighting the need for a more accurate and automated solution.


**Objectives**
1. The objectives of this project are to:
2. Develop a robust image processing pipeline.
3. Utilize computer vision techniques for object detection and counting.
4. Reduce human error while speeding up the counting process.


**Conclusion**
The project successfully developed an automated object counting system using image processing techniques, achieving the goals of accuracy, efficiency, and reliability. The proposed solution reduces human error, enhances consistency, and improves productivity compared to manual counting. Overall, the system demonstrates the potential of image processing to replace traditional counting methods with a more practical and scalable approach for real-world applications.
